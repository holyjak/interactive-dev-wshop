### Get up and running!

Is everybody ready, with the prerequisities (this folder, VS Code + Calva, Docker)?
Has everybody browsed through the README and the Cheatsheet?

Start the server, browse to [localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088/).

### Code walk-through

Everybody opens `src/interactive/server.clj`, walk through the code briefly, focusing on the big picture and the constructs they are going to need.

### Coding warm-up

Guide the people through the tasks in the top comment block.

### Tasks

#### Guided task 1

Complete the task 1 on the screen, explaining - use `def` to capture the request (and explain its use in deving vs. prod), explore it in the REPL, ... .

#### Individual work on tasks 2-4

Give them a few minutes for each task, walking around and helping.

Then do it on the screen and explain.
